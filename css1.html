    <h4><i>What is CSS?</h4></i>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.</li><br>
            <li>CSS described how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper or in other media.</li><br>
            <li><div>CSS is not necessary external</div><span>CSS saves a lot of works.</span></b>It can control the layout of  multiple webpages all at once.</li><br>
            <li><u>External stylesheet aree stored in CSS files.</u></li> <br>
        </ol>
        <h4>CSS can be added to HTMLelements in three ways:</h4>
         <ul type="Disc">
            <li>Inline -by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
            <li>Internal - by using a style element in the hear sections.</li>
            <li>External- by using a link element to link to an external CSS files.</li>
            <li>The most common way to add CSS,is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However,<b><span>In this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span></b> because this is easier to demonstrateand easierfor you to try it yourself.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When comparing CSS and ID ,the difference is that CSS applies a styleto multiple elements.ID, on the other hand ,applies a style to one unique elelment ,ID is also special in that you can a special URL to link to an element and its used by JavaScript. </p>
        <p>In CSS, selectors areused to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.Oncean element has been targeted,astyle or set of styles can be appliedto the element.  </p>
        <p>Ther is wide range of selectors available .Two od the most commonly used are class and ID .Both are used to target elements to which style should be applied.</p>
